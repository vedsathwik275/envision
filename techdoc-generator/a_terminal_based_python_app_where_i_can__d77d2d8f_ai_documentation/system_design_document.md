# System Design Document

## Title: Terminal-Based Neural Network Trainer

## Executive Summary
This document describes the design of a terminal-based Python application for training and deploying neural networks using CSV data. The application offers a user-friendly command-line interface, automates data preprocessing, generates neural network models, trains them, and enables predictions on new data. It aims to be scalable, maintainable, and follow industry best practices.

## Problem Statement
The challenge is to create an interactive terminal application that simplifies neural network training using CSV data. It should allow users to interactively choose target features, automate preprocessing, and handle model storage and predictions efficiently.

## Architecture

    B -- Displays Predictions to --> A;
```

## Components
- **User Interface Component:** Manages user interactions using `simple-term-menu`.
- **Data Handling Component:** Reads CSV files, processes data, handles missing values, scaling, and encoding.
- **Model Training Component:** Generates, trains, and saves neural network models.
- **Prediction Component:** Loads trained models to make predictions on new data.
- **CSV File:** Contains data for training and prediction.
- **Neural Network Model:** Represents the trained model.
- **Model Storage:** Stores the models for future predictions.

## Data Models
- **CSV Data Model:** Represents the structure of CSV files with rows and columns, including feature names and data types.
- **Neural Network Model:** Encapsulates architecture, weights, and metadata needed for predictions.

## APIs
- **Load CSV API:** Functionality to load and parse CSV files.
- **Preprocessing API:** Functions for data cleaning, scaling, and encoding.
- **Model Training API:** Interfaces for configuring, training, and saving neural networks.
- **Prediction API:** Provides methods to load models and make predictions.

## Integration Points
- **Keras API in TensorFlow:** For defining, training, and evaluating neural networks.
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **simple-term-menu:** For creating terminal-based menu interfaces.

## Requirements
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - Load and parse CSV files.
  - Provide a menu-driven interface for feature selection.
  - Automate preprocessing steps.
  - Train and save neural network models.
  - Load models for predictions.

- **Non-Functional Requirements:**
  - Scalability to handle large datasets.
  - Maintainability with clear code structure.
  - Usability with intuitive terminal interactions.

## Implementation
The application is implemented in Python with a focus on modularity. Each component is developed as a separate module, ensuring clear separation of concerns. The user interface is built using `simple-term-menu`, while data handling leverages Pandas for manipulation. Neural networks are implemented using Keras in TensorFlow, providing flexibility and efficiency.

## Alternatives
- **GUI-Based Alternatives:** Using a graphical user interface instead of terminal-based interaction for improved user experience.
- **Cloud-Based Solutions:** Deploying the application as a web service for broader accessibility and scalability.

By following this design, the application aims to provide a robust, efficient, and user-friendly tool for neural network training and prediction within a terminal environment.
