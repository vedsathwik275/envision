    terminal_menu = TerminalMenu(options)
    menu_entry_index = terminal_menu.show()
    return menu_entry_index

def select_target_feature(column_names):
    terminal_menu = TerminalMenu(column_names, title="Select Target Feature")
    menu_entry_index = terminal_menu.show()
    return menu_entry_index

# Example Usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    while True:
        choice = main_menu()
        if choice == 0: # Train New Model
            filename = input("Enter CSV filename: ")
            # Load CSV, get column names (example)
            column_names = ["feature1", "feature2", "target"] # Replace with actual column names
            target_index = select_target_feature(column_names)
            target_feature = column_names[target_index]
            print(f"Selected target feature: {target_feature}")
            # ...rest of the training process...
        elif choice == 1: # Load Existing Model
            # ...loading model and prediction logic...
            pass

**6. Data Preprocessing: Best Practices and Industry Standards**

Data preprocessing is crucial in machine learning, impacting model performance significantly. Best practices include:

  - Understand data to determine missing value patterns.
  - Use mean/median imputation for numerical data, mode for categorical.
  - Consider KNN imputation or model-based imputation.
  - Remove rows/columns with high missing value percentages if necessary.
  - Flag missing values for model learning.

- **Scaling Numerical Features:**
  - Use Z-score scaling for normally distributed data.
  - Use Min-Max scaling for data with specific range requirements.
  - Use Robust scaling for data with significant outliers.

- **Encoding Categorical Features:**
  - Apply one-hot encoding for nominal features.
  - Use label encoding for ordinal features.
  - Consider target encoding for performance improvement.

- **Feature Transformation:**
  - Apply log transformation for skewed data.
  - Use power transformations for handling both positive and negative values.
  - Create polynomial features for capturing non-linear relationships.

- **Best Practices:**
  - Split data into training, validation, and test sets.
  - Use cross-validation to prevent overfitting.
  - Select relevant features to reduce complexity.
  - Use pipelines for consistency and error reduction.
  - Experiment with preprocessing techniques and evaluate impact on performance.

**7. Neural Network Architecture and Training: Best Practices**

- Choose the appropriate neural network architecture (e.g., CNNs, RNNs) based on data characteristics.
- Implement dropout for reducing overfitting.
- Utilize early stopping to prevent training for too long.
- Experiment with different optimizers (e.g., Adam, RMSprop) for best results.
- Monitor training and validation loss to adjust model parameters.

**8. Scalability and Deployment Considerations**
