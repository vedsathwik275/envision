# MVP Outline Document

## Neural Network Training Platform - Minimum Viable Product

### 1. MVP Overview

The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for the Neural Network Training Platform will deliver the essential functionality needed to demonstrate the core value proposition: enabling users to upload data, select a neural network model, train it, and generate predictions without requiring machine learning expertise. The MVP will run locally with file system storage and support one use case (order volume prediction) as a proof of concept.

### 2. MVP Scope

#### 2.1 In Scope

- User interface for data upload and model selection
- Backend processing for data validation and model training
- Order volume prediction neural network implementation
- Basic results visualization
- Local deployment with file system storage
- Minimal error handling and validation

#### 2.2 Out of Scope for MVP

- Cloud storage integration (S3)
- User authentication and account management
- Multiple concurrent training jobs
- Advanced customization options for models
- Multiple use cases beyond order volume prediction
- Scheduled retraining and batch processing
- API for programmatic access

### 3. User Journey

The MVP will support the following user journey:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User opens web application] --> B[User uploads CSV data file]
    B --> C[System validates data format]
    C --> D[User selects order volume prediction model]
    D --> E[User initiates training with one click]
    E --> F[System trains neural network model]
    F --> G[System automatically generates predictions]
    G --> H[User views prediction results]
    H --> I[User exports prediction results as CSV]
```
