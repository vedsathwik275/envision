# Frontend UI Enhancement Todo List

## Overview
This document outlines the tasks for improving the visual appeal and user experience of the Envision Neural API Proof of Concept frontend. The goal is to create a polished, professional-looking demo interface while maintaining all current functionality.

## Visual Design Enhancements

### General UI Improvements
- [ ] Create a cohesive color scheme using transportation/logistics-themed colors
- [ ] Design and implement a proper logo for the Envision Neural header
- [ ] Add subtle background patterns or gradients to improve visual appeal
- [ ] Implement consistent spacing and padding throughout the interface
- [ ] Add subtle animations for state transitions (tab changes, loading states)
- [ ] Improve form elements with better styling (inputs, selects, buttons)
- [ ] Add responsive design improvements for various screen sizes

### Component-Specific Enhancements
- [ ] Redesign the navigation tabs with active state indicators and hover effects
- [ ] Enhance card styling with subtle shadows, rounded corners, and border effects
- [ ] Improve table styling with alternating row colors and better header styling
- [ ] Add visual progress indicators for file uploads and model training
- [ ] Design better modal overlay styling for model details
- [ ] Create styled notification toasts for success/error messages
- [ ] Improve loading spinners with branded colors and smoother animations

## User Experience Improvements

### File Upload & Preview
- [ ] Add drag-and-drop file upload capability
- [ ] Implement file type validation with user-friendly error messages
- [ ] Add progress bar for file uploads
- [ ] Enhance file preview with pagination for large datasets
- [ ] Add column sorting in the preview table
- [ ] Implement data type detection and appropriate formatting in preview

### Model Training
- [ ] Create visual training progress indicator with animated steps
- [ ] Add tooltips explaining each training parameter
- [ ] Implement form validation with inline error messages
- [ ] Add estimated training time based on selected parameters
- [ ] Create visual comparison between training and validation metrics
- [ ] Add expandable advanced options section for power users

### Model List & Details
- [ ] Implement filterable and sortable model table columns
- [ ] Add visual performance indicators (color-coded metrics)
- [ ] Create model comparison functionality for up to 3 models
- [ ] Enhance model details modal with tabs for different information categories
- [ ] Add performance metric visualizations (charts/graphs)
- [ ] Implement model version history timeline view

### Predictions
- [ ] Redesign prediction parameter forms with improved layout
- [ ] Add data visualizations for prediction results (charts, graphs)
- [ ] Implement interactive filtering of prediction results
- [ ] Create map visualization for geographic predictions (city pairs)
- [ ] Add CSV/JSON format toggle with syntax highlighting for JSON view
- [ ] Implement export options for visualizations (PNG, PDF)
- [ ] Add collapsible sections for prediction metadata vs. results

## Code Quality & Performance
- [ ] Implement CSS preprocessing with SASS/LESS
- [ ] Create reusable UI components to ensure consistency
- [ ] Optimize JavaScript for better performance
- [ ] Add client-side data caching for frequently used data
- [ ] Implement lazy loading for large prediction results
- [ ] Add error boundary handling for component crashes
- [ ] Create comprehensive JSDoc documentation for all functions

## Priority Items (For Immediate Implementation)
1. Color scheme and logo design
2. Card, form, and button styling improvements
3. Table styling enhancements for prediction results
4. Loading and error state visual improvements
5. Navigation and tab styling refinements
6. Model list visual indicators for performance metrics
7. Prediction results visualization improvements

## Implementation Guidelines
- Maintain all current functionality while improving visuals
- Ensure accessibility standards are met (contrast, keyboard navigation, etc.)
- Test on multiple browsers and screen sizes
- Prioritize performance - animations should be subtle and not impact usability
- Follow modern UI/UX best practices while keeping the interface intuitive
- Create a style guide document to ensure consistent implementation
