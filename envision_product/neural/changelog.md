## [0.2.0] - 2025-05-12 23:15

### Added
- Created API endpoints for model management and predictions in `api/models.py` and `api/predictions.py`.
- Implemented `ModelService` for handling model loading, saving, registration, training, and deletion.
- Added `PredictionService` for managing prediction generation and storage.
- Created file upload and data preview functionalities in `api/files.py` and `api/data.py`.
- Added fallback data generation in prediction to handle cases with missing training data.
- Implemented main API router to connect all endpoint modules.

### Changed
- Enhanced `OrderVolumeModel` with improved error handling throughout prediction pipeline.
- Modified model saving to include raw training data to ensure prediction availability.
- Updated model loading to create sample data when needed for prediction.
- Reduced the number of epochs during testing for faster model training.

### Fixed
- Fixed issue with missing training data during prediction by adding sample data generation.
- Added error handling for file paths, invalid lane IDs, and date parsing in prediction workflow.
- Fixed file upload API to generate file IDs internally.
- Corrected data preview functionality to handle the proper data processor interface.
- Added fallback prediction generation when no valid predictions can be made.

### Removed
- Removed unnecessary dependencies and unused service modules.
- Eliminated the separate `model_manager` and `training_service` in favor of integrated `ModelService`.
