# System Design Document

## Neural Network Training Platform

### 1. System Overview

The Neural Network Training Platform is a web-based application that enables users to upload data, select a neural network model type, and train it automatically without requiring machine learning expertise. The system is designed to be use-case agnostic, initially supporting order volume predictions but expandable to multiple neural network applications.
