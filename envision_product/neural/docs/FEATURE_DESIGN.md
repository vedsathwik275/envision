# Frontend Feature and Design Document

## Overview
This document outlines the features and design of the frontend application for the Neural Network Training Platform. The application is built using React and Material-UI, providing a user-friendly interface for uploading data, training models, and visualizing prediction results.

## Features

### 1. Dashboard
- **Welcome Section**: Provides an introduction to the platform and a button to start a new prediction.
- **Available Models**: Displays a list of trained models with options to view details.
- **Recent Predictions**: Lists recent prediction results with options to view detailed results.

### 2. File Upload
- **Drag-and-Drop Interface**: Users can upload CSV files using a drag-and-drop interface.
- **File Validation**: Ensures that uploaded files are in the correct format and size.
- **Upload Progress**: Displays the progress of file uploads.

### 3. Model Training
- **Model Selection**: Allows users to select a model for training.
- **Training Progress**: Displays real-time progress of model training.

### 4. Results Visualization
- **Prediction Chart**: Visualizes prediction results over time using line charts.
- **Results Table**: Displays prediction results in a tabular format with filtering and pagination.
- **Export Functionality**: Allows users to download prediction results as CSV or Excel files.

## Design

### User Interface
- **Material-UI**: The application uses Material-UI components for a consistent and modern design.
- **Responsive Layout**: The layout is responsive, ensuring usability across different devices and screen sizes.
