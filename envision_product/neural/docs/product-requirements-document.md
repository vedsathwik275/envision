# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Project: Neural Network Training Platform

### 1. Executive Summary

The Neural Network Training Platform is a web-based application that allows users to upload data, select a pre-configured neural network model corresponding to their use case, and train the model without requiring deep machine learning expertise. The platform handles data preprocessing, model training, and prediction generation automatically. Initially developed for order volume predictions, the platform is designed to be use-case agnostic and expandable to multiple neural network applications.

### 2. Product Vision

To provide a user-friendly platform that democratizes access to neural network technology, enabling businesses to leverage machine learning for predictive analytics without requiring specialized data science knowledge or infrastructure.

### 3. Target Users

- Business analysts who need predictive analytics but lack machine learning expertise
- Data scientists who want to quickly deploy and test neural network models
- Operations teams needing to forecast business metrics
- Small to medium businesses without dedicated machine learning infrastructure

### 4. User Problems

- Setting up and configuring neural networks requires specialized knowledge
- Data preprocessing is time-consuming and error-prone
- Training models requires significant computational resources
- Deploying trained models and generating predictions is technically challenging
- Businesses need predictive analytics for multiple use cases with minimal customization
